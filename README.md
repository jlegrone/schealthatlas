=============

SC Health Atlas is a source of health and social services data for South Carolina. The Atlas allows users to create and manipulate maps, find all services within a close proximity, get driving directions, and print or download our data. The purpose of the Atlas is to give South Carolinians the data and tools necessary to explore the availability of health and social services in their communities, and link people to the care they need. We regularly add new information to the Atlas, so we encourage you to visit often and let us know how the tool could be improved.

For more information or to give us feedback, please contact us at info@schealthatlas.org.
